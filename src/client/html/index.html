                    Hello I'm mortonprod, a physicist turned web developer.
                    Scott Hanselman told me I had to be a full stack developer so that's what I did!
                    Front to back with a little bit of command line usage.
                    I'm here to entertain you with the struggles of the transition.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Why would you want to read this?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well, you might learn something and who isn't entertained reading about other peoples struggles.
                </p>

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Now before we begin I would like a little bit of input from you guys.
                    Below you will find a list of the topics I have varying levels of experience in.
                    I want to know what you would like to read about.

                    Disclaimer
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I will focus on topics I am comfortable with but not an expert.
                    This means I might make the odd mistake.
                    However, I promise on Dan Abramov's future grave that I will be upfront with you at all times.
